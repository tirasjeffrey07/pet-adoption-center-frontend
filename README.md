## About

---
- This was made for my web dev internals.

- This is a frontend for a pet adoption centre made using HTML, CSS and JS.

- The repo also contains the php file(`send.php`) to send the data from the frontend to the Oracle SQL database

- FLuid button hover effects are added.

- The entire page follows a white and taupe color theme.

## More

---

- Contains 6 pages: Landing(`index.html`), home(`home.html`), explore(`explore.html`), contact us(`contact.html`), register(`register.html`), sign in(`signin.html`)

- `validate.js` is used to validate the input before sending it to the backend. Basic username and email validation is done using JS.

- `test.txt` contains some preliminary test code.
